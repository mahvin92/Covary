Covary is a deep learning framework for phylogenetic reconstruction that leverages the TIPs-VF genetic representation. TIPs-VF belongs to the Translator-Interpreter Pre-seeding (TIPs) family, a set of encoding schemes designed to enhance the numerical representation of genetic sequences for machine learning applications. By integrating Keras-based neural network architectures, Covary provides an efficient and scalable approach to reconstructing phylogenetic trees.

Versions:

Public release
2.1 – Adds user-defined plot customization and introduces filtering of sequence entries containing invalid characters, enabling faster and more reliable project implementation.
2.0 – Introduces codon normalization, resolving inconsistencies in the relationship between input sequences and open reading frames or protein translations within unaligned datasets.

Pre-release
1.3 – Optimizes the perplexity parameter for t-SNE, enabling reliable analysis of datasets with limited sample sizes.
1.2 – Reduces sequence ambiguity, improving support for datasets containing unprocessed or ambiguous genetic sequences.
1.1 – Enhances memory efficiency to prevent session crashes caused by RAM overload.
1.0 – Initial release (unsupported)
