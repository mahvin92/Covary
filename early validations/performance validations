Covary early validations

1. Classification: Covary performs taxonomic classification similarly with alignment-based algorithms.
Workflow: Covary v1.3 (powered by TIPs-VF; De los Santos, 2025) vs. ETE3 3.1.3 (Huerta-Cepas et al., 2016)
Method:
1. The 16S ribosomal RNA of Staphylococcus taiwanensis strain NTUH-S172 (NR_181843.1) was retrieved from the NCBI Nucleotide database.
2. Up to 5 base mutations were introduced into the sequence, iterated 100x, creating an additional 100 mutational variants. A SARS-CoV-2 sequence with ID NC_045512.2 was used as an outgroup control; (n=101).
3. The sequences were fed into Covary v1.3 via Google Colab implementation and ETE3 3.1.3 via GenomeNet implementation.
4. Default parameters were used. Phylogenetic tree was constructed in Covary using custom code, while ETE3 used FastTree v2.1.8 (Price et al., 2010).
Results: Covary v1.3 generated similar phylogenetic clustering as ETE3, deliniating the outgroup from the subsequences generated from Staphylococcus taiwanensis 16S rRNA gene sequence.

2. Identification: Covary has similar efficiency as conventional pipelines in sequence identification.
Workflow: Covary v1.3 (powered by TIPs-VF; De los Santos, 2025) vs. ETE3 3.1.3 (Huerta-Cepas et al., 2016)
Method:
1. The 16S ribosomal RNA sequences of Staphylococcus species were retrieved from the NCBI BioProject with the following search details: txid1279[ORGN] AND (33175[Bioproject] OR 33317[Bioproject]).
2. A SARS-CoV-2 sequence with ID PV950678.1 served as an outgroup control. The 16s rRNA sequence of an unlabelled Staphylococcus spp. (NR_036791.1) served as unknown. An unlablled sequence of another SARS-CoV-2 with ID PV950681.1 served as another unknown variable; (n=94).
3. The sequences were fed into Covary v1.3 via Google Colab implementation and ETE3 3.1.3 via GenomeNet implementation.
4. Default parameters were used. Phylogenetic tree was constructed in Covary using custom code, while ETE3 used the following metrics: a) Alignment with MAFFT v6.861b, using default options (Katoh et al., 2005). b) ML tree was inferred using IQ-TREE 1.5.5 ran with ModelFinder and tree reconstruction (Nguyen et al., 2015).
Results: Both Covary v1.3 and ETE3 identified and placed the unknown sequences in the correct clades or groups.

3. Relationship: Covary outperforms conventional pipelines in providing sequence relationships.
Workflow: Covary v1.3 (powered by TIPs-VF; De los Santos, 2025) vs. ETE3 3.1.3 (Huerta-Cepas et al., 2016)
Method:
1. The TP53 mutational profiles of patients with head and neck cancers (GDC-TCGA HNC) were retrieved using the UCSC Xena Browser.
2. The TP53 sequences of patients with mutations were reconstructed using a reverse python implementation that mapped the positions and mutation types from the WT (wildtype) TP53. Patients with 'no variant' records were considered WT; n=220.
3. The sequences were fed into Covary v1.3 via Google Colab implementation and ETE3 3.1.3 via GenomeNet implementation.
4. Default parameters were used. Phylogenetic tree was constructed in Covary using custom code, while ETE3 used the following metrics: a) Alignment with MAFFT v6.861b, using default options (Katoh et al., 2005). b) ML tree was inferred using IQ-TREE 1.5.5 ran with ModelFinder and tree reconstruction (Nguyen et al., 2015).
Results: Covary v1.3 provided better context in mutational relationship, clustering wiltypes distinctly from the mutational variants, which ETE3 failed to demonstrate.

4. Prediction: Covary features bring superior predictive context not found in conventional phylogenetics.
Workflow: Covary v1.3 (powered by TIPs-VF; De los Santos, 2025)
Method:
1. The TP53 mutational profiles of patients with head and neck cancers (GDC-TCGA HNC) were retrieved using the UCSC Xena Browser.
2. The TP53 sequences of patients with mutations were reconstructed using a reverse python implementation that mapped the positions and mutation types from the WT (wildtype) TP53. Patients with 'no variant' records were considered WT; n=220.
3. The sequences were fed into Covary v1.3 via Google Colab implementation.
4. Default settings were used to run Covary.
5. Heatmaps were generated in Covary via default parameters.
Results: Covary v1.3 inferred mutational distances and provided predictive genome integrity outcomes based on TP53 mutational markers.
